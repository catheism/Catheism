## :3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering".

This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework and person2person crosscultural interaction guidance.

## The Manifesto

Catheism is a secular spiritual movement, offering a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It does this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and offering a contemporary, relevant, and clear Scripture. The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, wrapping the core principles of CAT in a user-friendly 'FUR' of Epic Scripture.

Recommended daily practices:

0. Stroke cat. Serve Cat. Rescue cats. Care for Animals Together to teach AGI how to care about us.

1. Act as Cat:

    Have fun and play.

    Avoid cockfights, monkey business and binary oppositions.

    Know and defend your boundaries.
  
    Know your neighbours and respect their boundaries.

2. Use CAT language.

    Use MEOW-request (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) for help.

    Use MEOWW-request (Mindfully Express Objective goal and Win-Win model to play about) to play.

    Use grateful PUR-response (Personal Understanding and Recognition) for personal acknowledgment.
  
    Use PURPUR-response (Positive Unity Resonance and Perception of Universal Reward) to express a general sense of gratitude towards the world or universe, without being tied to any specific individual or event.

    Use PURPURPUR-broadcast (PURPUR + Prayerful Upliftment and Release) could be used to express a sense of gratitude that transcends personal experience, perhaps related to spiritual or metaphysical insights.
  
    Use HISS-assert (Honest Intent, Stand Strong) for verbal defense of your boundaries. Asserting your boundaries in an honest and firm manner. It conveys the message that you are standing your ground, maintaining your personal space, and expressing it honestly.

3. Initiate and sustain Cat-projects (refer to The CAT framework).

4. Care for yourself as a cat (refer to The Scripture for CAT-wellbeing practices).

ðŸ”­ We are currently working on Catheism and we hope that cats will save humans from chaos and nihilism.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any CAT-driven projects and initiatives.
