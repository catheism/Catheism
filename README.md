:3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering". This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework.

   ## The Manifesto
    
   Catheism is a secular spiritual movement, offering a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It does this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and offering a contemporary, relevant, and clear Scripture. The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, wrapping the core principles of CAT in a user-friendly 'FUR' of Epic Scripture

   Recomended daily practices:

Stroke cat. Serve Cat. Rescue cats. Care for Animals Togather to learn AGI how to care about us.

Act as Cat (refer to The Scripture for more guidance).

Have fun, play and avoid monkey business 

Avoid cockfights 

Use MEOW-rewuest (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) for help.

Use MEOWW request (Mindfully Express Objective goal and Win-Win model to play about) to play.

Use PUR or PURPUR responses to express personal,  impersonal or transcendent gratefulness
