:3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering". This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework.

   ## The Manifesto
    
Â Â Â  Catheism is a secular spiritual movement, offering a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It does this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and offering a contemporary, relevant, and clear Scripture.

Â Â Â  As a Catheist, we recommend you engage in at least two of the following best practices daily:

a. Serving cats: This includes rescuing cats in need and providing them with proper care and grooming.

b. Emulating cats: Cats embody many qualities worth emulating. Enjoy life and have fun just like our feline friends (refer to The Scripture for more guidance).

c. Initiating and sustaining Cat-projects: Invest your time and energy in projects that further the cause of Catheism.

d. Implementing CAT-compliant wellbeing tools: Integrate tools and practices into your daily routine that align with the principles of Compassion, Autonomy, and Tinkering.

e. MEOW (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) for help but never whine

The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, wrapping the core principles of CAT in a user-friendly 'FUR' of Epic Scripture
