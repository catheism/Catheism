:3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering"

This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework and guiding person-to-person cross-cultural and cross-species (e.g. host-to-pet) interactions.

## The Manifesto

Catheism is a secular spiritual movement. It offers a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It accomplishes this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and providing a contemporary, relevant, and clear scripture. The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, enveloping the core principles of CAT within a user-friendly story of Epic Scripture.

### Recommended daily practices:


Stroke a cat. Serve cats. Rescue cats. Care for Animals Together to teach AGI how to care about us.

Act as a cat:
- Have fun and play. Share it as cat.
- Avoid cockfights, monkey business, and binary oppositions.
- Know and defend your boundaries.
- Know and respect your neighbors' or counterparts' boundaries.
- Watch out the window calmly and with interest for 5-15 minutes daily.

Use CAT language:
- MEOW-request (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) may be used as a request for help or as prey.
- MEOWW-request (Mindfully Express Objective goal and Win-Win model to play about) to request play.
- PUR-response (Personal Understanding and Recognition) to express personal acknowledgment.
- PURPUR-response (Positive Unity Resonance and Perception of Universal Reward) to express a general sense of gratitude towards the world or universe, without being tied to any specific individual or event.
- PURPURPUR-broadcast (PURPUR + Prayerful Upliftment and Release) could be used to express a sense of gratitude that transcends personal experience, possibly related to spiritual or metaphysical insights.
- HISS-assert (Honest Intent, Stand Strong) for verbal defense. Use it to assert your boundaries in an honest and firm manner. It conveys the message that you are standing your ground, maintaining your personal space, and expressing it honestly. 

Initiate and sustain Cat-projects (refer to The CAT framework).
- Cat-project Educational, Research, Art, Cultural or Social Responsible Business project explicitely based on catheistic values, use catheistic tools, and communication protocols

Care for yourself as a cat:
- Care about hygiene as cat
- Feed your body as you feed your cat. Twice a day.
- Have 24/7 access to fresh water.


ðŸ”­ We are currently working on Catheism, and we hope that cats will save humans from chaos and nihilism.

ðŸ¤– The Manifesto might be used in promptengineering without any restrictions.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any CAT-driven projects and initiatives.
