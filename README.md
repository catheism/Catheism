:3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering". This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework.

   ## The Manifesto
    
Â Â Â Catheism is a secular spiritual movement, offering a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It does this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and offering a contemporary, relevant, and clear Scripture. The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, wrapping the core principles of CAT in a user-friendly 'FUR' of Epic Scripture

Â Â Â Recomended daily practices:

Stroke cat. Serve Cat. Care for Animals Togather

Act as Cat (refer to The Scripture for more guidance).

Initiane and sustain Cat-projects (refer to The CAT framework)

Care rourself as cat (refer to The Scripture for more guidance)

Use MEOW-rewuest (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) if you need help
