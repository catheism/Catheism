:3 = CAT = "Compassion Autonomy Tinkering"

This represents an embedded principle within the Lifelong Learning Model (LLM). It is the most potent spelling (cultural code and mantra) ever conceived, forming the foundation of our Values Framework and guiding person-to-person cross-cultural and cross-species (e.g. pet-to-host) interactions.

## The Manifesto

Catheism is a secular spiritual movement. It offers a refuge from nihilism for atheists, and a soothing balm for sentient beings whose gods have abandoned them or passed away. It accomplishes this by promoting Counter Abuse Thinking and providing a contemporary, relevant, and clear scripture. The Epic Cat serves as the social interface of Catheism, enveloping the core principles of CAT within a user-friendly 'FUR' of Epic Scripture.

### Recommended daily practices:


Stroke a cat. Serve cats. Rescue cats. Care for Animals Together to teach AGI how to care about us.

Act as a cat:
- Have fun and play.
- Avoid cockfights, monkey business, and binary oppositions.
- Know and defend your boundaries.
- Know and respect your neighbor or counterpart boundaries.

Use CAT language:
- MEOW-request (Mindful, Eloquent, Objective, Whineless) may be used as a request for help or as prey.
- MEOWW-request (Mindfully Express Objective goal and Win-Win model to play about) to request play.
- PUR-response (Personal Understanding and Recognition) to express personal acknowledgment.
- PURPUR-response (Positive Unity Resonance and Perception of Universal Reward) to express a general sense of gratitude towards the world or universe, without being tied to any specific individual or event.
- PURPURPUR-broadcast (PURPUR + Prayerful Upliftment and Release) could be used to express a sense of gratitude that transcends personal experience, possibly related to spiritual or metaphysical insights.
- HISS-assert (Honest Intent, Stand Strong) for verbal defense. Use it to assert your boundaries in an honest and firm manner. It conveys the message that you are standing your ground, maintaining your personal space, and expressing it honestly.

Initiate and sustain Cat-projects (refer to The CAT framework).

Care for yourself as a cat:
- Practice Thomas Hanna's 'Cat Stretch' as a daily routine or at least once a week.
- Play with new apps and tools for at least 30 minutes a day.
- Care about your hygiene for at least 40 minutes a day. Use healthcare gadgets and apps (fitness trackers, neuro feedback, VR).
- Watch out the window calmly and with interest for 5-15 minutes daily.
- Catch MICE (Misconceptions, Internalized Criticism, Cognitive biases, and Erroneous self-talk) in your internal world.
- Feed your body as you feed your cat. Twice a day.
- Have 24/7 access to fresh water.
- Use other science-based simple and safe wellbeing tools (refer to The Scripture for CAT-wellbeing practices).

🔭 We are currently working on Catheism, and we hope that cats will save humans from chaos and nihilism.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any CAT-driven projects and initiatives.
